# ProductionLineOOP

This project is a GUI that allows you to add product names, types and manufactures to the database. This project 
allows me to demonstrate my knowledge on how to handle buttons, add combo boxes and have a choice box. I made the project (Jana Grunewald) with help from other students across both COP 3003 - Object-Oriented Programming classes. I started this project on 23 September 2019 and has been on going until 28 September 2019. I am at intermediate level with java and at an advanced level with CSS. I made this assignment for COP 3003 - Object-Oriented Programming. This assignment reflects me as a person by the way the 
colours are paired and how the items are displayed. I made it partially at school at Florida Gulf Coast University in COP 3003 - Object-Oriented Programming and finished most of it at home.

## Getting Started

First you need to download IntelliJ (https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jetbrains.com%2Fidea%2Fdownload%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNE_PgkWWh-ZuOBH6MD2d0a8HcXUWA ) or another IDE that will run JavaFX. You will need Java 11 JDK (https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fjdk.java.net%2Farchive%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGwG_cwrP8Dtz6zkHr2Wxjz1-HGCg ) and SDK (https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgluonhq.com%2Fproducts%2Fjavafx%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNG5akTTb_MlF5BmoCOmRJTChO_cLQ ) to run the project (additionally
you can use Java 8 JDK and SDK but you will need to change the version under project structure when you open it). You will also need 
H2 downloaded (https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.h2database.com%2Fhtml%2Fmain.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNE13ZojBzC3TFQrckdHkhQj-cPn-w ) and Scenebuilder (https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgluonhq.com%2Fproducts%2Fscene-builder%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFAj9kP87nkoEPWc9GSwux6cctk0w ). After you install IntelliJ, you can download the project and open the main file. You need to make sure you set up H2 to point to the resource folder. After you have everything set up, you should be able to run the project and see the different styles applied to the GUI.

## Built With

 - IntelliJ - This is a new IDE to me. I only know the basics.
 - Scenebuilder - This is a new software to me. I only know the basics.
 - H2 dadabase builder - This is a new system to me. I only know the basics.
 - Java 8/ Java 11 JDK - Java 8 is better for JavaFX

## History

The initial commit had just the GUI layout and the ReadMe. After The initial commit, the controller was updated with the button variables. I then made the handleActions for the buttons which are hardcoded to print to the console. I then populated the combobox in the intitialize method after creating the local variable for the combobox. I then added fx:ids to all of the elements in FXML. I then added styles to the GUI using the fx:ids to make each item be a different colour.
